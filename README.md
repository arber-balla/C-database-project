# Hi there, I'm Arber! 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student based in Italy 🇮🇹 with a passion for developing efficient software systems and solving complex problems. This project is a simple, yet powerful database implemented in C, designed to handle basic database operations such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating data.

## 💻 What This Project Does

- **Database System in C:** A simple database that supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Data Storage & Retrieval:** Implements efficient data structures to store and retrieve data.
- **Memory Management:** Focuses on proper memory management and optimization for handling data efficiently.
- **Modular Code:** The project is organized into modular components for easy maintenance and extension.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

- **C Programming:** The core language used to implement the database system.
- **File Handling:** Data is stored persistently using file I/O techniques.
- **Memory Management:** Emphasis on dynamic memory allocation and freeing resources.
- **Modular Architecture:** The project is organized into various submodules (tables, pages, utilities) for better maintainability and scalability.
